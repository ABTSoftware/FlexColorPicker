# Flex Color Picker
Modern &amp; flexible iOS HSB Color picker component written in Swift. Great UX, high performance and open design: You can set or override almost anything, on your responsibility.

With FlexPickerViewController you can have great color picker up and running in a minute, or you can customize visual and experience to best fit your app, or you your can use FlexColorPicker as a framework to build your own color picker. This library gives you exactly as much flexibility as you need.

Use cases supported:
1. ready-to-use color picker that works great out-of-box
2. agile library that supports components positioning via autolayout and customisation directly from storyboard (or from code)     
3. framework that allows adding your own sliders, palettes &amp; previews or modifying existing ones without changing the code of the library
4. combine 3 approaches above freely to get level of customisation that you need

Features

- full code-only support
- freely combine, leave out or add your own picker components
- great UX and simplistic yet customisable design
